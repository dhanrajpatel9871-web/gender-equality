    <h1>About Gender Equality</h1>
    <p>
      Gender equality is the state in which people of all genders have equal rights,
      responsibilities, and opportunities. It promotes fairness in education,
      employment, political participation, and access to healthcare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite progress, gender disparities still exist in many societies,
      affecting economic development, health outcomes, and social well-being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Achieving gender equality benefits everyone by creating a more just and inclusive world.
